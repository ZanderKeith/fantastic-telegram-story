It was a chilly spring morning, one best spent in relaxation and enjoying a cup of tea.
Regrettably, that is not what Sir Buckingham, Esquire was pursuing at this moment.
"Curse this wretched machine!"
He got up from his workbench in a huff.
"I have worked on this blasted contraption for four and twenty days now, and I'm no closer to getting it sorted than when I began!"
He stared out the window, thinking longingly of the sunshine he would miss, and dreading the long day of work ahead.
"I must consult sundry technical manuals."
Before he could begin perusing the first one though, there came a knock at the door to his chamber.
Quickly, he turned around, retied the belt of his robe, jumped into his morning slippers, set his tea back on his workbench, and made for the door.
"Who's this?"
There was no reply. 

He opened the door of his small, secluded abode a cracked and peered outside. He
looked out to the find the rising sun, a cool breeze, and the many trees that
surrounded his house, but there was no one there. With a grunt he returned to 
his workbench. He stared the at the puzzling machine, and it stared back
reminding him that he forgot about the manuals. Upon finally finding what he was
looking for, the knock came again. He stormed back to the door and yanked it
open, only this time someone was there.

“Oh it’s you. Are you here to help me or to disturb me?” 
“I am here to help, could you show me your machine?” said a boy from the town. 
“Alright, but this time, no touching, … ?”
Even before Sir Buckingham finished his sentence, the boy ran and went to the machine.
“Do not touch the machine boy!” Sir Buckingham yelled.
The cup of tea was getting cold, as if it signals the time to begin work, and Sir Buckingham walked into the room. But there was no boy.
