It was a chilly spring morning, one best spent in relaxation and enjoying a cup of tea.
Regrettably, that is not what Sir Buckingham, Esquire was pursuing at this moment.
"Curse this wretched machine!"
He got up from his workbench in a huff.
"I have worked on this blasted contraption for four and twenty days now, and I'm no closer to getting it sorted than when I began!"
He stared out the window, thinking longingly of the sunshine he would miss, and dreading the long day of work ahead.
"I must consult sundry technical manuals."
Before he could begin perusing the first one though, there came a knock at the door to his chamber.
Quickly, he turned around, retied the belt of his robe, jumped into his morning slippers, set his tea back on his workbench, and made for the door.
"Who's this?"
There was no reply.
